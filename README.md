# The  Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival
Just another project for openclassrooms

# Summary
The  Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival, that will happen from August 5th  to 8th at Brooklyn Bridge Park is a major
entertainment venue in New York, capable  of holding up to 5,000 people. For this event, a website as an advertisements
measurement needs to be created, to announce the upcoming shows and take reservations.

The website should contain information about the festival,  the films they're showing,  news and announcements about the
festival. Include links  to the city of Brooklyn’s news website,  Brooklyn Bridge Park’s website, and our Twitter,
Instagram, and Facebook accounts. The whole project will be registered under a .com or .org address.

## The goal of this tiny project
Create a website, that is suitable for customers of all ages, i.E. no horror or other graphical content that is not
suitable for younger people or sensitive viewers.  All movies should be represented by a picture, length, a little plot.
The site should be done before August the 5th.
